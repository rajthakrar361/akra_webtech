      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <img class="hq" src="assets/headquaters.jpg" alt="AKRA Headquaters">
      <p>
        AKRA Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. is now the world's largest vaccine manufacturer
        by number of doses produced and sold globally (more than 1.5 billion doses) which
        includes Polio vaccine as well as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hib, BCG,
        r-Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccines. It is estimated that about
        60% of the children in the world receive at least one vaccine manufactured by AKRA Institute.
        Vaccines manufactured by the AKRA Institute are accredited by the World Health Organization,
        Geneva and are being used in around 170 countries across the globe saving millions of lives throughout the world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>AKRA Institute of India is ranked as India's No. 1 biotechnology company,
        manufacturing highly specialized life saving biologicals like vaccines using
        cutting edge genetic and cell based technologies, antisera and other medical
        specialties.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The Philanthropic philosophy of the company still not only exists but has
        been proliferated to bring down the prices of newer vaccines such as Hepatitis-B vaccine,
        Combination vaccine etc., so that not only Indian's, but the entire under-privileged
        children of the world are protected from birth onwards.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In these tough times we also make sure that least amount of vaccine which we
        supply is being wasted and we also keep an eye on every AEFI (Adverse event following immunization)

        installing robotic arm for virus handling, cell factory and cell cube for growing cells,
        facilities for the manufacture of polysaccharide and recombinant vaccines and for monoclonal antibodies.
        Sophisticated tunnel systems, high speed vial washing, filling, stoppering and sealing machines
        are capable of working at a speed of 500 containers per minute and have been installed with filling
        accuracy to the third digit of decimal point to ensure accuracy and consistency.

      <p>
        AKRA Institute has the latest technology screeners to inspect its products for
        any minute particulate matter undetectable to the normal human eye. Configured with high

          With the licensure of additional facilities, we has the flexibility to produce
         vaccines in more than one plant, thus facilitating production of large number of doses in the shortest
         time frame. This enables us to improve the response time to cater to any international emergency
         or outbreak.
